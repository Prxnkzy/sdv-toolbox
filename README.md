# Welcome to the Generoso SDV-toolbox !

## Overview
The Generoso SDV-toolbox is a comprehensive Python toolkit designed to streamline pre-pentest operations. It supports a range of activities including DNS lookups, vulnerability assessments, reverse shell connections, password strength testing, and report generation.

## Installation
Clone the repository to get started with the Generoso SDV-toolbox:

    git clone https://github.com/Prxnkzy/sdv-toolbox.git
    
## Features
**Domain check-up**: Uses DNSPython to resolve nameservers for specified domains.

**Vulnerability scan**: Leverages Nmap for scanning ports and services, employing NSE scripts for detailed checks.

**Reverse shell**: Establishes reverse shell connections using Netcat, facilitating remote system access.

**Password analyzer**: Calculates the time required to brute-force a password, based on a study by Hive Systems.

**Reporting**: Automatically generates comprehensive reports detailing scan outcomes and security insights.

## Usage
**Domaine check-up**:
Enter a target IP address to retrieve the DNS, MX, and TXT records.

**Vulnerability scan**:
Enter a target IP address to scan, the attack level, and the ports.
+ *-Pn: Disables the ping phase, treating the host as active.*
+ *-T: Specifies the scan's aggression level (1 being the slowest and stealthiest, 5 being the fastest and noisiest).*
+ *-sV: Service version detection.*
+ *--script=vuln: Executes vulnerability detection scripts (NSE).*
